### Execution & Recovery Notes
* **Frequency**: Repeat the cycle (Days 1-2-3, Rest, Days 1-2-3).
* **Progressive Overload**: Aim to increase weight or add one extra rep every week.
* **Intensity (RPE 8-9)**: Stop the set when you feel you could have done at most 1 or 2 more reps with perfect form.
* **Rest Periods**: 2-3 minutes for compound exercises and 60-90 seconds for isolation exercises.
* **Eccentric Phase**: Control the descent of the weight (2-3 seconds) to maximize mechanical tension and muscle stretch (Stretch-Mediated Hypertrophy).
